# Used Bike Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the selling prices of used bikes based on key features such as brand, model, kilometers driven, year, and more.

## Project Description

In the second-hand vehicle market, pricing transparency is critical. This project aims to build a regression model that accurately predicts the price of used bikes using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, and Machine Learning techniques.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations
- Feature engineering for model optimization
- Model training using algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Evaluation using metrics like RÂ² score and RMSE

## Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- `Bike Name`
- `Year`
- `Selling Price`
- `Present Price`
- `Kms Driven`
- `Fuel Type`
- `Seller Type`
- `Transmission`
- `Owner`

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/used-bike-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Open `Used Bike Prices.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all the cells to explore the analysis and model results.

##Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment using Streamlit or Flask
- Incorporating more bike brands and locations
